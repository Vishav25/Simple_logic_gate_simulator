# Logic Gate Simulator

This is a simple PyQt5 application for simulating basic logic gates: NOR, NAND, and XOR. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can select input values and simulate the behavior of these gates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and PyQt5 installed on your machine.
```bash
pip install PyQt5


How to Use :-
1. Upon launching the application, you will see a window with two dropdowns (comboboxes) for selecting input values (0 or 1).
2. Select input values from the comboboxes.
3. Click on one of the three buttons: NOR, NAND, or XOR to perform the corresponding logic operation.
4. The result will be displayed below the buttons.
